Just walked out of the theater, and MAN, Death of a Unicorn has my brain running marathons while my body's demanding protein. I swear, it's like the   left me hanging in some parallel universe — half awe, half what-the-heck. Seriously, I can lift heavy stuff all day, but processing this flick was like deadlifting emotions with spaghetti straps.

The whole unicorn thing — I mean, unicorns? Isn't that like some children’s bedtime story gone rogue? Except the bedtime story was on caffeine, speed, and a dash of midnight existential crisis. I guess what I'm saying is, if you wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   that turns your beliefs about fairytales inside out and wrings them dry like a sweaty workout towel, this is it. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or whatever people say nowadays.

And the characters? They're those people who you kinda love even when they annoy the bejeezus out of you. Some scenes had me squirming in my seat like I'd just done leg day but forgot to stretch. Look, no spoilers, but there’s this moment where everything shifts and it's like, oh... cool... yeah... or maybe not? I don't even know. Does anyone know? Life's trippier than a pre-workout shot.

> But also, what’s with the music? Who knew xylophones could sound that moody? Makes you feel like you're floating on a cloud but then crash down 'cause hey, it's a   about the death of something as pure as a unicorn. Like, what’s next? The Resurrection of Bigfoot?

Here's where my caveman C++ skills randomly kick in for no reason:
// This has zero to do with the unicorn but whatever
int unicornBelief = 1;
if (unicornBelief == 1) {
   printf(Unicorns live
);
} else {
   printf(Unicorns are mythical);
}

Thinking back, maybe it hit harder ’cause I'm tired, you know? All of us talking outside the theater, half of us yawning, tossing ideas around like it’s confetti — and by ideas, I mean how none of us really understood why we loved it or if we just got swindled by some cinematic pixie dust. At least I know one thing: might be tough to get those damn xylophone tunes out of my head before tomorrow's early gym session.
